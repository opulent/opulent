<p># grunt-preprocess

Preprocess HTML and JavaScript with directives based off ENV configuration

Consider looking at [grunt-env](https://github.com/onehealth/grunt-env) for easier environment configuration.

## What does it look like?

```html
<head>
  <title>Your App

  
  
</head>
<body>
  
  <p>
  <!-- @include welcome_message.txt -->
  </p>
</body>
```

```js 
var configValue = '/* @echo FOO */' || 'default value';

// @ifdef DEBUG 
someDebuggingCall()
// @endif

```

## Directive syntax

### Simple syntax

The most basic usage is for files that only have two states, non-processed and processed.
In this case, your directives for exclude are removed after the `preprocess` task

```html
<body>
    
</body>
```

After build

```html
<body>
</body>
```

### Advanced directives

 - `@if VAR='value'` / `@endif`
   This will include the enclosed block if your test passes
 - `@ifdef VAR` / `@endif`
   This will include the enclosed block if VAR is defined (typeof !== 'undefined')
 - `@ifndef VAR` / `@endif`
   This will include the enclosed block if VAR is not defined (typeof === 'undefined')
 - `@include`
   This will include the source from an external file
 - `@exclude` / `@endexclude`
   This will remove the enclosed block upon processing
 - `@echo VAR`
   This will include the environment variable VAR into your source

### Extended html Syntax

This is useful for more fine grained control of your files over multiple
environment configurations. You have access to simple tests of any ENV variable

```html
<body>
    
    <header>Your on dev!</header>
    

    

    <script>
    var fingerprint = 'undefined' || 'DEFAULT';
    </script>
</body>
```

With a `NODE_ENV` set to `production` and `0xDEADBEEF` in
`COMMIT_HASH` this will be built to look like

```html
<body>
    <script src="some/production/javascript.js"></script>

    <script>
    var fingerprint = '0xDEADBEEF' || 'DEFAULT';
    </script>
</body>
```

With NODE_ENV not set or set to dev and nothing in COMMIT_HASH,
the built file will be

```html
<body>
    <header>Your on dev!</header>

    <script>
    var fingerprint = '' || 'DEFAULT';
    </script>
</body>
```


### JavaScript Syntax

Extended syntax below, but will work without specifying a test

```js
normalFunction();
//@exclude
superExpensiveDebugFunction()
//@endexclude

anotherFunction();
```

Built with a NODE_ENV of production :

```js
normalFunction();

anotherFunction();
```




## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [Gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-preprocess`

Then add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-preprocess');
```

## Configuration and Usage

grunt-preprocess is a Grunt Multi Task that takes your
standard source and destination and processes a template based
around environment configuration.


```js
preprocess : {
  html : {
    src : 'test/test.html',
    dest : 'test/test.processed.html'
  },
  multifile : {
    files : {
    'test/test.processed.html' : 'test/test.html'
    'test/test.processed.js'   : 'test/test.js'
    }
  },
  inline : {
    files : [ 'processed/**/*.js' ]
    inline : true
  },
  js : {
    src : 'test/test.js',
    dest : 'test/test.js'
  }
}
```
