# Opulent Comments

Single line comments are marked up with a forward slash character `/`.

```sass
/ This is a comment
```

## Block Comments
Block comments are marked up with two forward slash characters `//`.

```sass
// This is a block comment.
   It is on multiple lines.
```

## Output Comments
By default, comments are only for reference inside Opulent files. You can output them
by adding an exclamation character `!`, to resemble HTML.

```html
/! This comment will be outputted
```

```html
<!-- This comment will be outputted -->
```
